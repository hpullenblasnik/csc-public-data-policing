## What Does Data "See"? Public Data, Biases, and Surveillance in NYC

This repository provides a hands-on coding activity for the Barnard CSC talk, "What Does Data 'See'? Public Data, Biases, and Surveillance in NYC." The talk discusses public data uses for social science research, with special attention to Census data and data available through the New York City Open Data Portal. It prompts for us to ask questions about why data was produced, for what purposes, and what biases it may have as a result. The presentation then discusses studies that have used data to uncover such biases, before exploring how researchers have collected data that is intentionally hidden, such as on police surveillance.

This coding activity provides an introduction to Census data at the tract level, with an introductory overview of downloading, cleaning, graphing, and mapping such public data. We look at the census tract level for population and racial demographics, and then compare this data to police stops in New York City. It ends with pulling in surveillance camera data created by Amnesty International's Decode Surveillance project. Please view their GitHub for more details on the data, code, and their full analysis: https://github.com/amnesty-crisis-evidence-lab/decode-surveillance-nyc/

This repository contains R files to participate in the activity and a completed activity with the code to run the visuals. It also includes a data folder that contains inputs and outputs for the analysis.
